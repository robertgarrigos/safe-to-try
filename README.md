# Safe to Try

**Safe to Try** is a cooperative card-based game to explore and practice decision-making by consent, inspired by Sociocracy 3.0.

Players face real-world challenges through cards representing shared contexts, personal constraints, emotional roles, and group values. Through structured rounds, the group listens, reflects, raises objections, and adapts proposals—until they find a solution that’s “good enough for now, and safe enough to try.”
