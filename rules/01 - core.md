# Safe to Try – Core Rules

<!-- T:intro -->
**Safe to Try** is a cooperative card game for practicing decision-making by consent, inspired by Sociocracy 3.0. Players take on roles, explore real-life challenges, and learn how to listen, object, and co-create proposals that are “good enough for now, and safe enough to try.”

## <!-- T:sections --> Game Structure

### <!-- T:phases --> Phases

The game consists of the following phases:

1. **Context Reveal**: Draw a Context + Proposal card.
2. **Role Assignment**: Each player draws a Personal Situation and an Emotional Role card.
3. **Reaction Round**: Players react to the proposal (round of clarifying questions or quick impressions).
4. **Consent Round**: Players either consent, express concerns, or raise objections.
5. **Proposal Adaptation**: If needed, the group adapts the proposal until consent is reached.

## <!-- T:principles --> Principles

- **Equivalence**: All voices are valued.
- **Transparency**: Proposals and objections are discussed openly.
- **Consent**: No objections = green light.
- **Good enough for now**: Perfection is not required.
- **Safe enough to try**: Action can begin if no one foresees unacceptable risks.

---

## <!-- T:winning --> Win Condition

The goal is not to “win” against others, but to **find proposals that the group can safely try**, using structured consent and collaboration.

Optionally, you may use point trackers or reflections to observe group effectiveness and emotional safety.

---

## <!-- T:variants --> Variants

- **Facilitator role**: One player guides the process without a personal role.
- **Timed rounds**: Add timers to simulate real-world constraints.
- **Thematic decks**: Use context cards from specific domains (e.g., school, nature camp, co-op, NGO...).
